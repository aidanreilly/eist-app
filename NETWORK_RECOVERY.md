# Network Connectivity Recovery for éist Radio App

## Overview

This implementation adds automatic network connectivity detection and recovery for the éist radio stream. When users switch between networks (e.g., WiFi to 5G, or lose/reconnect to the internet), the app will automatically handle the transition and attempt to recover playback.

## Features

### Network Change Detection

- **Real-time monitoring**: Uses `@react-native-community/netinfo` to detect network changes
- **Mobile network types**: Detects WiFi and cellular connections (optimized for mobile devices)
- **Connection status**: Monitors both connection status and internet reachability

### Automatic Recovery

- **Playback preservation**: Remembers if the stream was playing before a network change
- **Smart recovery**: Automatically attempts to restart the stream when connectivity is restored
- **Stability delay**: Waits 2 seconds after network restoration to ensure stability before recovery
- **Clean reset**: Performs a complete stream reset when recovering to ensure fresh connection

### Graceful Degradation

- **Automatic stop**: Stops playback when network connectivity is lost
- **Metadata preservation**: Maintains show metadata display even when stopped
- **Error handling**: Handles network-related errors gracefully

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`hooks/useNetworkConnectivity.ts`** (New)
   - Custom hook for network state management
   - Provides network state information and change detection
   - Filters out insignificant network changes

2. **`context/TrackPlayerContext.tsx`** (Modified)
   - Integrated network connectivity monitoring
   - Added network change recovery logic
   - Enhanced play/stop functions with useCallback for stability

3. **`app.json` & `app.config.ts`** (Modified)
   - Added NetInfo dependency
   - Updated Android permissions for network state access

### Key Components

#### Network State Interface

```typescript
interface NetworkState {
  isConnected: boolean;
  isInternetReachable: boolean | null;
  type: string | null;
  isWifi: boolean;
  isCellular: boolean;
}
```

#### Recovery Logic

The recovery process works as follows:

1. **Network Change Detection**: Monitors for significant network changes
2. **State Preservation**: Remembers if playback was active before the change
3. **Automatic Stop**: Stops playback if connectivity is lost
4. **Recovery Attempt**: Automatically restarts playback when connectivity is restored
5. **Clean Reset**: Performs a complete stream reset to ensure fresh connection

### Network Change Scenarios Handled

- **WiFi to Cellular**: Automatically recovers playback
- **Cellular to WiFi**: Automatically recovers playback
- **Connection loss**: Gracefully stops playback
- **Connection restoration**: Automatically resumes playback
- **Network type changes**: Detects and handles appropriately

## Usage

The network recovery is fully automatic and requires no user intervention. Users will experience:

- **Seamless transitions**: When switching between WiFi and 5G, playback continues automatically
- **Graceful handling**: When losing connectivity, playback stops cleanly
- **Automatic recovery**: When reconnecting, playback resumes automatically
- **No manual intervention**: All recovery happens in the background

## Dependencies

- `@react-native-community/netinfo`: Network connectivity detection
- React Native permissions: `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` (Android)

## Testing

To test the network recovery:

1. Start playing the radio stream
2. Switch between WiFi and cellular networks
3. Turn off WiFi/cellular and observe playback stopping
4. Re-enable network connectivity and observe automatic recovery
5. Check console logs for network change detection messages

## Console Logging

The implementation includes comprehensive logging for debugging:

- Network change detection events
- Recovery attempts and success/failure
- Playback state changes during network transitions
- Error handling and fallback behavior

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:

- **Retry logic**: Multiple recovery attempts with exponential backoff
- **User notifications**: Inform users about network-related playback changes
- **Quality adaptation**: Adjust stream quality based on network conditions
- **Offline mode**: Cache content for offline listening
