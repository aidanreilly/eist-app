# Ã©ist Apple iOS and Google Android app

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## A hacking we will go ðŸª“

Download the expo dev app on your device.

Clear previous build instances:

```cmd
npx expo start --tunnel
```
Use the development build, we are using native components so we can't use expo go. 

`r` reloads the app.

## Native dev build

First delete previous App store installed Ã©ist app.

```cmd
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```
**Note**: Ignore `setSleepTimer` warnings, not using this in the app.

**NB**: Use the dev build, not expo.

```cmd
npx expo start --clear --tunnel
```

## Build and deploy to App stores

Make changes and uprev the `app.json` version.
